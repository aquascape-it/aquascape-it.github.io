      <description>Preparing the driftwood was a step in the set up process that has caught me off guard. I have used driftwood in the past when I had a pet reptile, it was easy. You just add the driftwood, maybe change the arrangement, and done!
For an aquarium, preparing the driftwood can be done in minutes all the way to weeks. One of the biggest factors is your willingness to use non-natural supplies.</description>

      <description>I have recently stumbled on this amazing hobby called Aquascaping. It&amp;rsquo;s artistic, creative, scientific, and perfect for anyone with deep curiousity. There is a vibrant community of people who have shared so much wisdom and information, I am very grateful to everyone.
In this journal, I hope to share my experiences with Aquascaping so others may learn from my successes and failures.
Now I want to talk about what gave me the initial inspiration to start this hobby.</description>
